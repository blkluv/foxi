  Proposals can now be **upvoted by the community**, making it easy to identify which ideas resonate the most ‚Äî from the frontlines to the boardroom.

- **Live Ranking Leaderboard**  
  See the **top-rated proposals** rise organically. No more static PDFs. The most valuable ideas surface transparently through user momentum.

- **Real-Time Feedback Loop**  
  Participants can **leave comments, suggest tweaks, and signal interest**, creating an active feedback loop that improves proposal quality before final submission.

- **Gamified Transparency**  
  Voting is public and timestamped, encouraging trust, fairness, and stakeholder accountability ‚Äî while still feeling fun and engaging.

### üß† Why It Matters

Traditional RFPs rely on **manual scoring matrices**, internal debates, and opaque selection processes. These methods often:
- Prioritize politics over merit
- Ignore collective intelligence
- Delay decision-making
- Deter innovation

Our new upvoting model **flips the script**. By letting your team, users, or community **vote up the best-fit solutions**, RFP scoring becomes:
- **Faster**
- **Fairer**
- **More inclusive**
- **More dynamic**
