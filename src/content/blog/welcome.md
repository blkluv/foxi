### 💡 Why We Built It

> “Procurement shouldn’t be a black box. It should be a public dialogue.”

Old RFP systems were slow, clunky, and closed off. Scoring was often arbitrary. Good ideas got buried.  
RFP.AUCTION changes that by giving everyone—from local governments to solo entrepreneurs—a space to **build in public** and **win as a team**.
