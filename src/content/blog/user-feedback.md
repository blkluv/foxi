### 💬 Why Feedback Matters in a Social RFP App

> “When ideas are public, feedback is power.”

Traditional RFP tools lacked room for dialogue. On **RFP.AUCTION**, community feedback loops help proposals evolve **before** deadlines. Whether you’re a creator, vendor, or decision-maker, the ability to react, refine, and upvote creates a smarter, more agile procurement process.

Your feedback helps us close the gap between idea and implementation — and ensures the best proposals rise to the top.
